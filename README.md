# classr Application
**Main Contributors: Ryan Wisniewski & Charlie Penvari**

classr is a light weight desktop app that will track college credits and will allow users to plan out their college career. 

**Current Project Status**

We are making decisions on UI Layout, program structure and features. 

**Where to Find Information**

Inside the \Planning Resources\ directory is the original proposal for the project. Currently, that document is a good starting point to understanding what the end result might look like. 

When it is done, we will put our app's wireframe in that directory. 

**Dependencies**

Python 3.7 (Virtual Environment is included)

PyQT5
