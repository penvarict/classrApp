classr is a light weight desktop app that will track college credits and will allow users to plan out their college career. 

**Current Project Status**

We have created the initial user interface.

**Where to Find Information**

Inside the \Planning Resources\ directory is the original proposal for the project. Currently, that document is a good starting point to understanding what the end result might look like and what features can be implemented.  

Also, on GitHub we are using the project boards to track bugs and things that need to be done.
