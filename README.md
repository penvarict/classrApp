# classr Application
**Main Contributors: Ryan Wisniewski & Charlie Penvari**

classr is a light weight desktop app that will track college credits and will allow users to plan out their college career. 

**Current Project Status**

The project is stable with minimal bugs. See project board to see known bugs.

**Where to Find Information**

Inside the \Planning Resources\ directory is the original proposal for the project. Currently, that document is a good starting point to understanding what the end result might look like and what features can be implemented.  

Also, on GitHub we are using the project boards to track bugs and things that need to be done. 

**Dependencies**

- **Python 3.7 or later, Virtual Environment is included but not configured with PyQt5**

- PyQt5.QtWidgets
  - We import all (*) currently
- PyQt5.QtCore
  - Qt (we need Qt package for scroll bar policies)
- sys (included in Python 3)
- logging (included in Python 3)
- math (included in Python 3)



**Contribution Guide**

Clone the repository. Off of the main branch, create a working branch that is named 'GitHubUsername-FeatureName'.

In pull requests, please specify the files that were changed and why they were changed in the pull request description. 

If you have ideas for features, you may add to the project board on this Github Repository. You may also create your own branch and then add drawings for UI improvements to the Planning Resources directory. From there, put in a pull request and we will get to reviewing it as soon as possible.
